# Butterboard

Tired of using wires? Butterboard is an enchanced perforated
prototyping board! Each main hole has a nearby GND and VCC connection,
as well as two vertical and two horizontal bus connections. GND and
VCC pads are already routed, the planes are evenly distributed across
the board via grid pattern. It was initially designed for 4-layer
boards, but later we realized that the same design can be easily
done on just 2 layers.

Butterboard is fully open-source, you are free to make your
modifications and produce it as long as you share your changes. The
board can be procedurally generated by running the script as a KiCad
plugin. Currently we only provide gerbers for 50x100mm boards. You can
generate other sizes yourself, but it is probably easier to just ask
us to generate a custom board for you.

## Getting the boards

You can get these boards from regular PCB manufacturers. It should
cost you less than 0.9$ per board for 20 boards (<18$).

### Making an order on JLCPCB

* Download [gerber files from the latest release](https://github.com/RGVID-EU/Butterboard/releases)
* Make an order https://jlcpcb.com/quote

When ordering, select these options:
* PCB Qty: 10
* Panel By JLCPCB: Yes (x: 2 50mm, y: 1 100mm)
* Edge rails: **no**

You will get 10 panels with two 50x100mm boards each (20 boards in
total). Total price with shipping will be different depending on your
location, but it should be around 18$ or less.
